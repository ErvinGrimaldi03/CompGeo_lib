# CompGeo_lib

#### What is this?
This is a *work-in-progress* collection of Data Structures and algorithms used in computational Geometry.
Most of the algorithms and Data Structures are based on the cs 164 lectures, tought by Dr. Eppstein, professor in the ICS department at UC Irvine.

#### What is the use for all of this?
None really. Is mostly to see how all the concepts learned in the class can be applied and wrote in a programming language.
However, with some modification and smart use of what this repository contians, it should not be hard to have some application out of this.

#### Why Python?
Simply because it's faster to type everything up. It's obvious that Python is not ideal for computational geometry, or worse, computer graphics. 
I might convert everything in C++ or Rust in the future. But for now I will use Python.


#### How do I use this?
Well, right now it's really impractical, but the documentation will be written bit by bit.
